<h2>Games</h2>
	<h3><a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/54/space-10000km">Space: 10000km</a><sup>[Ludum Dare 54]</sup></h3>
	<p>Adventure/Puzzle game made in Godot, I aimed to emulate an early 2000's artstyle. A large focus was put on cutscenes. I like the asteatics, although they would've been largely enhanced by better and more sound design. The main failure in this project was the ux.</p>
<br>
	<h3><a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/53/stl-last-mile">STL: Last mile</a><sup>[Ludum Dare 53]</sup></h3>
	<p>A deliery sim with a focus on 3d movement, made in Godot. I think the movement works out but the rest of the gameplay is lacking.</p>
